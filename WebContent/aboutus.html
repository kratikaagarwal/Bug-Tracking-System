		<h3>What is a Bug Tracking System?</h3>
<p>
A bug tracking system is software which can be designed to help programmers in keeping track of reported bugs in their software products. This can be seen as a form of issue tracking system. A bug tracking system allows user to report a bug directly to the concerned people who can fix it. A bug tracking system can be integrated with some other software management application and can be used internally in a software developing organization to improve the team work efficiency.</p>

What are its Services?</h3>
<p>

A bug tracking system maintains a database that records all facts about all detected and reported bugs. The detail about a bug may include its severity, the unexpected program behavior, the identity of user who reported it and identity of expert who fix it.
A bug can assign status according to the stage of its life cycle and can be moved from one status to another status like new, assigned, closed and more. Only an administrator should be allowed to configure the different states of a bug. The complexity of fixing a bug does not depend on the severity of that bug.
